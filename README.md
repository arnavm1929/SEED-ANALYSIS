# 🌱 SEED ANALYSIS — YOLOv8-based Classification and Detection

This project uses **YOLOv8** models to analyze and classify seed images using computer vision.  
It includes scripts for **real-time webcam prediction**, **dataset preprocessing**, and **model-based inference**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Trained YOLOv8 models for:
  - Seed classification (`yolov8n-cls.pt`)
  - Pose estimation (`yolov8n-pose.pt`)
  - Segmentation (`yolov8n-seg.pt`)
- Python scripts for webcam-based detection and analysis.
- Modular design for easy experimentation and retraining.

## 🧠 Model Information
The trained weights are stored in this repository via **Git LFS**:
- `yolov8n-cls.pt` — classification model  
- `yolov8n-pose.pt` — pose model  
- `yolov8n-seg.pt` — segmentation model  

These models were trained locally on custom datasets.
